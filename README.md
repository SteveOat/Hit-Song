<h1>Introducing Dataset</h1>
lorem

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dataset offers a detailed overview of contemporary music, featuring 620 tracks from 87 chart-topping artists between 2000 and 2023. It highlights the diversity of modern pop and R&B, capturing the evolution of Hot 100 hits over two decades. Each track is annotated with Spotify's audio features, providing insights into characteristics like tempo, energy, danceability, and valence, making it a valuable resource for exploring trends in popular music.

<h1>Key finding</h1>

Working on Spotify's api data
1. Visualize characteristics of hit songs on Billboard charts.
2. Find the most streamed genre on platform.
3. Does the artist's fame affect whether a song makes it onto the Billboard charts?

<h1>What is "Billboard" and Why "Spotify"</h1>
Songs make it to the **Billboard** charts (Top Hot 100) based on three key factors:

1. *Streaming* : Plays on platforms like ***Spotify***, Apple Music, YouTube, etc.
2. *Sales* : Digital and physical sales (e.g., iTunes, vinyl).
3. *Radio Airplay* : Number of times the song is played on radio stations.

Billboard compiles this data weekly from sources like Nielsen SoundScan and MRC Data to rank songs.<br>The combination of these factors determines a song's position on the charts.

<h1>Preparing Data</h1>

> Remove **Bracket "()"**  from "Track" column to match the text format of song's name.

> Remove **Space " "** and transform every text to lowercase.

> Splits **"Artist and Title"** into **"Artist"** , **"Track"**

> Merge the tables and filled *NaN* value in **"main_genre"** with *Unknown*.

> Remove duplicate **"Artist"** column that happened after merging.

> Create new column by combining rows that have the same song name but are sung by different artists to differentiate them.

<h2>2. Find the most streamed genre on platform.</h2>

![newplot (14)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35ad2e04-b9c9-421c-8428-e6ed70ceb0e9)

> The *NaN* Data

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The **Pop** genre is by far the most streamed on the platform, with a huge margin over other genres. But the presence of a significant number of *"Unknown"* labels affects the clarity of the data and should be noted when interpreting these results.

<br>

![newplot (17)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23f16954-1b47-43b6-b0ab-628694e67849)

> More clarify data

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this dataset, the *"Unknown"* label only accounts for 1.19 billion streams, which is much lower than in the first dataset. This gives us more confidence in the genre distribution and allows for more accurate conclusions.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the "Streams by Genre" chart, we can clearly see that **Pop is the most dominant genre**, with a staggering 200.77 billion streams, making it far more popular than any other genre on the platform.

Other significant genres include:

 - **World/Traditional**, with 45.05 billion streams, and
 - **R&B/Soul**, with 26.11 billion streams.

These genres are still popular but are dwarfed by Pop's massive stream count.

<h2>3. Does the artist's fame affect whether a song makes it onto the Billboard charts?</h2>

<h4>
  Let's highlight an important point about quality versus quantity when it comes to music tracks by artists.
</h4>

![newplot (16)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab5b443e-1611-470a-a3a6-c070d8793b5d)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Artists with fewer tracks but high average popularity** (like J Balvin, Grupo Frontera, and Tyler Childers) suggest that, even though they release fewer songs, the songs they do release are very popular and well-received. This implies a focus on quality over quantityâ€”the fewer songs they release tend to be hits, indicating that their music resonates strongly with listeners.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, **artists with more tracks but lower average popularity** (like Latto and Lizzo) might indicate that their popularity is driven more by their overall fame and brand as artists, rather than the quality of each individual song. While they produce a larger volume of music, not every track necessarily becomes a standout hit. This could imply that their success may rely more on their established name rather than consistently high-performing songs.
